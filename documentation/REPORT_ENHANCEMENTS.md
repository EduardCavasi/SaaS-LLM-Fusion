## Technology Emphasis

Both reports now emphasize:

### Backend Technologies (Heavily Emphasized)
- **Spring Boot 3.5.7** - Core framework
- **Spring Data JPA** - Data access
- **Spring Web** - REST API
- **Spring AOP** - Aspect-oriented programming
- **Hibernate/JPA** - ORM
- **H2 Database** - In-memory database
- **Lombok** - Code generation
- **Maven** - Build tool

### Frontend Technologies
- **Next.js 16** - React framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling

### Verification Technologies
- **Z3 SMT Solver 4.13.0** - Theorem proving
- **Custom Runtime Monitor** - LTL checking
- **Spring AOP** - Instrumentation

## Structure Improvements

1. **Better Flow**: Logical progression from overview → theory → implementation → results
2. **Complete Context**: Each report now covers the entire project while focusing on specific verification approach
3. **Professional Format**: Table of contents, proper sections, code listings
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All aspects of the project are documented

## What Each Report Focuses On

### Runtime Verification Report
- Emphasizes: Spring AOP, concurrent data structures, temporal property monitoring
- Shows: How runtime verification complements static verification
- Demonstrates: Non-invasive instrumentation, real-time monitoring

### Z3 Theorem Proving Report
- Emphasizes: SMT encoding, constraint solving, pre-execution verification
- Shows: How Z3 integrates with Spring Boot
- Demonstrates: Automated theorem proving in practice

## Next Steps for Students

1. **Update Author Names**: Replace "Student Name" with actual names
2. **Customize Content**: Add any specific implementation details
3. **Compile**: Use `pdflatex` or `latexmk` to generate PDFs
4. **Review**: Ensure all sections are accurate and complete

## Key Sections in Each Report

1. Title, Author, Abstract, Team
2. Project Overview (NEW)
3. Theoretical Background (NEW)
4. Project Structure (NEW)
5. Backend Implementation (ENHANCED)
6. Design (UML diagrams)
7. Implementation (source code)
8. Experimental Results
9. Conclusion (ENHANCED)
10. References

Both reports are now comprehensive, professional, and ready for submission!
